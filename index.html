    <h2> My Inspiration<h2>
      <h3> My Inspiration is Susmita Sen.Sushmita Sen  is an Indian actress and model who was crowned Femina Miss India in 1994 and won Miss Universe 1994 at the age of 18. She is the first Indian to win the Miss Universe crown. Sushmita's sen ageant gown was actually made from fabric she sourced at Delhi’s flea market Sarojini Nagar.
        After buying the fabric from Sarojini Nagar market, Sushmita gave it to a local tailor downstairs and asked him to make a good dress from it,  her mother made a small rose from the remaining bit of cloth. They also bought new black socks, cut it, added elastic to it and I wore them as gloves! This tell us that You don't need money to get what you want, your intention should be right.”
